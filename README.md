## 🧠 Python Modules and AI Domains Used

### Python Modules:
- `streamlit` — For building the web interface
- `os`, `shutil`, `pathlib` — For file handling and directory navigation
- `socket`, `platform` — To fetch device IP and OS details
- `requests` — For network and IP-related queries
- `humanize` — For making file sizes user-friendly
- `streamlit_extras` — For UI enhancements
- `streamlit_modal` — For displaying modals

### AI Domains:
While this project doesn't use traditional AI algorithms, it demonstrates core **AI application domains**:
- **Human-Computer Interaction** – User-friendly interfaces via Streamlit
- **Edge Computing** – Computation and file handling locally, not on the cloud
- **Automation** – Handling repetitive file operations and secure transfers without user intervention
